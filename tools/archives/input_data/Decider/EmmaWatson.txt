In the mean time please assume no news from me just means I’m quietly spending the pandemic the way most people are - failing to make sourdough bread (!), caring for my loved ones and doing my best not to spread a virus that is still affecting so many people.
If I have news - I promise I’ll share it with you.

Rumours about whether I’m engaged or not, or whether my career is “dormant or not” are ways to create clicks each time they are revealed to be true or untrue."

I donate to @Mermaids_Gender and @mamacash. If you can, perhaps you’ll feel inclined to do the same. ❤️
I want my trans followers to know that I and so many other people around the world see you, respect you and love you for who you are.
Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren’t who they say they are.

@G7 @10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson Every week, two women in England and Wales are killed by their current or former partner. To date, 34 states in the Council of Europe have ratified the Istanbul Convention.📝❤ Let’s not drag our feet on this any longer, @10DowningStreet! Let’s be number 35!
@G7 @10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson ⚖️The Istanbul Convention makes govts responsible for combating violence against women &amp; domestic violence. 🌹I’ll be proud to say my country is committed to preventing violence against women when the UK govt ratifies the Istanbul Convention &amp; fully complies w/ its requirements.
@G7 @10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson 🌎 We're asking states to ratify all relevant gender equality standards: https://t.co/7qdNRAZQLf 🌍 There are some incredible global treaties &amp; conventions that set minimum standards for women's &amp; girls’ rights 🥀 but some G7 states haven’t yet stepped up &amp; made them a reality.
