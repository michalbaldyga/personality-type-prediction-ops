Steven Curnow, 14
Cassie Bernall, 17
Isaiah Shoels, 18
Matthew Kechter, 16
Lauren Townsend, 18
John Tomlin, 17
Kelly Fleming, 16
Daniel Mauser, 15
Corey DePooter, 17"
I’ll never forget that morning: Everyone was in tremendous shock, but witnessing Craig, holding Michael’s hand, mustering the strength to speak about waiting for Rachel to walk out of the building as well as what he witnessed on that day… was unbelievably powerful.
23 years ago, two teens opened fire at #Columbine HS, killing 12 of their classmates and a teacher. The next day, with this close-knit Colorado community deep in mourning, I sat down with Craig Scott, who lost his sister Rachel, and Michael Shoels, who lost his son Isaiah. https://t.co/dg2vm5w35U
On April 4, a white police officer shot and killed a Black man, #PatrickLyoya, during a traffic stop in Grand Rapids, Michigan. On Tuesday, an independent autopsy revealed that Lyoya, who was unarmed, was shot in the back of the head. https://t.co/0tY7IFRT6J #kcm
