I was heartbroken to learn about the passing of Stephen “tWitch” Boss, who I got to know over the years through my Let’s Move! initiative and visits to The Ellen Show. My heart goes out to his wife, Allison, and his three children during this difficult time. https://t.co/C5AEmlfOrj

What’s something that you’ve picked up as a hobby or practice that has helped you during these last few years? Reply with your thoughts or tag me in your post using #TheLightWeCarry.
During the peak of the pandemic, when everything felt so bleak, the act of stitching, purling, casting on and off is how I kept my anxiety at bay. Practicing it roots me in this idea that I talk about in my book, The Light We Carry called “the power of small.” 🧶
Every time I tell people how much I love to knit, they seem so surprised! But it truly has become one of my most meaningful (and fun) pastimes. For me, knitting is a release. It lets my hands lead the way as my mind trails behind. #TheLightWeCarry https://t.co/xkFwib6qox
"Chicago! Thanks for a terrific show—and a special thanks to @hmcghee for leading such a meaningful conversation.

In #TheLightWeCarry, I write about some of their recent experiences navigating adulthood and everything that comes along with it. It is such a joy to watch them forge their own path in the world. In so many ways, they are my light.

In their own way, these women keep me grounded when times are tough. They listen to me vent. They help me see myself. They give me laughter and love. And I’m so grateful for each and every one of them.
I often refer to my close friends as my “Kitchen Table.” The friends at my table come from all different parts of my life — college, Chicago, DC, and every other period, too. #TheLightWeCarry https://t.co/j1KjTnJfiJ

#TheLightWeCarry is dedicated to them. I’ll forever be thankful for the flame they lit inside of me.
"I wouldn’t be who I am today if it wasn’t for my parents, Fraser and Marian Robinson. 

The lessons they taught me, the support they gave me, and the love they showed me — that foundation might be the most important gift of my entire journey. https://t.co/VwpCIRYOt4"
Because even when the world feels dark and uncertain, we always have the ability to kindle our own light by looking inside ourselves and then sharing it with others. #TheLightWeCarry ❤️ https://t.co/IZWLMRHrcD
Some of these tools are habits. Some are actual physical objects. Others are attitudes and beliefs from my ongoing journey of becoming. I poured a lot into this book, and my hope is that it might give you some ideas for your own journey.
That’s when I began the writing process. I think of #TheLightWeCarry as a toolbox of sorts. It’s a collection of practices and perspectives that I draw on when I need to stay balanced and confident, especially in times of anxiety and stress.
And then, the pandemic hit, leaving us isolated at home during a time of uncertainty. And like everyone else, I had a lot of questions about how to overcome anxiety and fear when it felt like the ground was moving beneath us—and I heard those questions from so many of you, too.
Four years ago, when I released my memoir, Becoming, I traveled across the country and around the world, meeting so many incredible people—including many of you. It was a little scary to share so much of my story for the first time, but I was so moved by your response. https://t.co/RUDCs1cEKe

"“Malala is a great woman! She fought for education and for this reason I want to be like her. I admire her, and my class section is even named after her at my school."" Claudia, Sololá, Guatemala https://t.co/MPtHVa7aP7"
“Whenever I’m needing confidence, I look at role models like Malala. She taught me about the importance of education for girls all over the world and how we all have to stand up for each other. I’m committed to doing that.” -Allena, Hawai’i, USA https://t.co/5nRhEWZoL3
“In my community, many girls don’t finish school. My parents encouraged my education, but there were times when I felt my dreams slipping away. Malala gave me an example of strength and determination to take inspiration from. I’m proud to say I graduated.” -Clare, Kampala, Uganda https://t.co/YXkEJUVOBs
As we celebrate #MalalaDay today, we asked young women from the @GirlsAlliance to tell us how @Malala inspires them. Check out what they shared below:
"I'm thrilled that some of the students from our @GirlsAlliance had the chance to attend the @WNBA All-Star game in my hometown! 🏀

Through the @ObamaFoundation, Barack and I are making sure young people in Chicago have access to exciting opportunities like this. https://t.co/iPBGYqMr1o"
Many parents rely on schools to make sure their kids have access to consistent meals. During the summer that need doesn't go away. I'm thrilled the @ObamaFoundation is teaming up with Local Lunchbox and local chefs to give young people in Chicago free, healthy meals this summer. https://t.co/q1jsjLjoF0
We miss him already, but his spirit lives on in his family members, including my dear friend @ProfessorEA, and all who were lucky enough to be blessed by his presence.
Cliff was an American original—a civil rights trailblazer whose eyes were never shut to injustice but whose heart was always open. He was like a father to me and an inspiration to Barack. We admired the way he fought and learned from the way he led. https://t.co/klT0HLXL3a
These words were recited by Elizabeth Alexander at Barack’s inauguration in 2009—but they also describe how her father, Cliff Alexander, lived. https://t.co/Dj22BLvuYP
Happy birthday, Malia – and Happy Fourth of July, everybody! 24 years ago, this day became extra special when your wonderful spirit arrived in this world. I’m so proud of the beautiful, caring, and driven young woman you’ve become. I love you so, so much! Love, your Mommy. ❤️ https://t.co/VLWbKrs51d
My thoughts on the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. https://t.co/9ALSbapHDY
To all those who have been on the frontlines of this issue—calling their representatives, organizing their neighbors, raising awareness in their hometowns: thank you. There is a lot of work ahead, but this progress couldn’t have been possible without your efforts.
The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is a step in the right direction in protecting our children and communities. It demonstrates how much we can accomplish when we work together, even in the wake of today’s disappointing Supreme Court ruling on guns.
For 50 years, #TitleIX has pushed girls to dream bolder and bigger, and has led to some of America’s greatest athletic achievements—from grand slams to gold medals to a women’s World Cup. @ESPN’s 37 Words celebrates that remarkable progress. I loved it—and I know you will too! https://t.co/2uceaBPLpJ
Congrats to the Class of 2022! You’ve persevered through one of the most extraordinary times in our history, and now it’s time to make your mark on our world. I believe in you and will be rooting for you every step of the way! 🎓🎉👏🏾 https://t.co/7GYhBA9mTm
"Barack and I always want to make sure that young people feel confident and capable of making a difference. 
 
That's one of the reasons we created the Futures Series at the @ObamaFoundation, so students on the South Side understand there is no dream too big for them to dream. https://t.co/JubGrnYo6k"
Queen @Beyonce, you’ve done it again! “Break My Soul” is the song we all need right now, and I can't help but dance and sing along while listening to it. Can’t wait for the album! 💃🏿
Happy Father’s Day to dads everywhere! @BarackObama, thanks for being the most loving and caring father to our girls. We love you! ❤️ https://t.co/QBZ0vhwTi8

Today is about coming together and honoring those before us who reached for progress, who helped build this country with their bare hands, who marched, fought, and protested—who did everything they could so that we might have a voice and a vote. #Juneteenth
Juneteenth is a day of power—a chance to celebrate our history and our triumphs, our resilience and our struggle.
Now is the time to do all we can to change the culture around voting. I hope you’ll join @WhenWeAllVote in doing this work—we need everyone to get involved and do their part to build a better and more inclusive democracy not only for us, but for the generations to follow. https://t.co/cBva8KmPXG

"This #AAPIHeritageMonth, I’m proud to celebrate young leaders like Leināʻala—a student in the @GirlsAlliance in Hawai’i. As she says, “My heritage means the world to me. It touches everything I do. This month is all about sharing our pride. That's how I want to use my voice."" https://t.co/m5rnk2j9w4"
Democracy is – and always has been – on the line. In Our Unfinished March, @EricHolder dives deep into how our democracy has been fractured and lays out a plan for what we can do to defend it. It's a book worth adding to your summer reading list. https://t.co/ynsnv4OR2A
The one and only @Oprah has been such a wonderful friend to me and Barack over the years—and it meant so much to write about her remarkable legacy for #TIME100. Hope you’ll take a look! https://t.co/mQ9IayI1Rn
There’s nothing I love more than meeting with young people. Today, I had the chance to talk with some of the bright high school students from DC with @ReachHigher who shared their stories and plans for the future. I’m so proud of them and can't wait to follow their journeys. https://t.co/IfG65DrJ5x

If you're a rising college junior in the U.S., apply right now: https://t.co/nez2BKmAnB https://t.co/WTG0kIsUix
So when you get home from marching, check your voter registration status with @WhenWeAllVote and encourage others to do the same at https://t.co/PA4LvmFR0D.
If any of you are questioning whether or not your vote matters, I get it. But remember that state lawmakers are the ones who will determine whether abortion is safe, legal, and accessible in your communities. And we are the ones who determine our state lawmakers. https://t.co/Nafi5LfC8i
But we don’t have to stand idly by while others try to turn back the clock on progress. I’m so inspired by everyone out marching today. And I know that we’re going to see so many folks carrying this energy forward to the elections in November and in every election after that.
It’s been a tough couple of weeks since we saw the leaked SCOTUS draft opinion on abortion. Even if we knew the courts were heading toward this day, it doesn’t make the frustration, grief, and fear any less real.
Decades before our family lived there, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt planted a Victory Garden on the White House lawn—and I'm thrilled to share that the Fruit &amp; Vegetable Garden at the Obama Presidential Center will be named in her honor. I can’t wait for you all to visit! https://t.co/wAMwaAHn18

The South Side made my brother Craig and me who we are today, so it was extra special seeing him go back to participate in our @ObamaFoundation Futures Series. By sharing his story, he’s letting these young people know that they can also dream big and accomplish their goals. https://t.co/arvuPVBnW0

I was so moved to see Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmed this afternoon. Like so many of you, I can’t help but feel a sense of pride—a sense of joy—to know that this deserving, accomplished Black woman will be a part of the highest court in the land. https://t.co/hnPcDuPt8w
In her book, she uses the lens of the 2020 movement for racial justice to explore its impact on the Black experience—the joy, the fear, the frustration. It is powerful, poignant, and deeply moving. I hope you’ll check it out. https://t.co/2UNjkvebvG
Here's to you, @ProfessorEA! Not only is she an exceptional author and educator, she is also a trusted friend—one whose insights have challenged me to see the world in new and different ways. I’m excited to share that her latest book, “The Trayvon Generation,” is available now. https://t.co/f5hEvP0QLo
Antilynching legislation was first introduced over a century ago—and failed to pass over 200 times. Now, the Emmett Till Antilynching Act is a chance to reckon with our history, and move in a new direction—one that makes this country safer and more just for us all.
Yesterday, President Biden signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act into law—finally designating lynching as a federal hate crime in the United States. For many Black folks, this historic moment comes with a lot of different emotions—I know it does for me.
Congratulations, @Questlove and the team at @SummerOfSoul, for your #Oscar win! Barack and I were so moved by this celebration of Black music, culture, and joy. What you did in telling this overlooked story is so important—and we are grateful for artists like you leading the way!

And thanks to all of you, that’s exactly what we did. 

Do you remember that day, or were you involved in the campaign in any way? I would love to hear your story. Use #Obama08 to share your memories."
Fifteen years ago, Barack announced his candidacy in Springfield. It was bitter cold, but as far as my eyes could see, there were people everywhere.

Waffles + Mochi are back—and just in time to celebrate the holidays with a couple of friends! We had some fun starting a new tradition, Freezie Day—along with some new songs and adventures. Watch our new Holiday Feast episode with your family today on @Netflix! 🎄❄🎁 https://t.co/oGHekfypja
I am so proud of these young leaders who are putting in the work to build on their leadership skills, connect with one another, and make a bigger impact across Africa. The work they're doing couldn’t be more important. Barack and I will be cheering these #ObamaLeaders on! https://t.co/goe7AxWhaO
So, I’d love to hear from you today! Reply and share your own #IAmBecoming story, and let me know what you've discovered about yourself. I can’t wait to hear from you! 💕
I can't believe it’s been three years since Becoming was released! I’m grateful for every person who read my memoir and shared their own #IAmBecoming story with me—whether it was in person on the book tour or here on social media. I’ve loved hearing you reflect on your journeys. https://t.co/fMb5SRHw7l
Today and every day, I could not be more grateful for the extraordinary service and commitment of our nation’s troops, veterans, and their families. I hope we all can find a way to give back to all those who have given us so much. #VeteransDay https://t.co/vLPjkaPGBV
I love this! This is exactly why we created Ada Twist, Scientist, through Higher Ground – to inspire budding young scientists like yours to experiment on their own. Hoping he makes some great discoveries! https://t.co/KoD2Js96Fb

Today is Election Day! From city hall and the governor’s mansion to the school board and the courts — state and local elections can have a profound impact on your day-to-day life. So if your city or state has an election today, make sure your voice is heard by voting!
Barack and I always loved celebrating Halloween back at the White House. I hope all those trick-or-treating tonight have a safe—yet spooky—time! 👻🎃 https://t.co/eMuvKqAqaV

I’m so encouraged that the @POTUS and @VP have issued the first-ever national strategy on gender equity and equality. It’s about making sure that every single person can reach their full potential—in our country and around the world. It’s what real leadership looks like. https://t.co/muDDCBJpvD
So this can’t be the end of our fight. We’re going to keep working to protect access to the ballot box at @WhenWeAllVote—and we hope you'll join us: https://t.co/PA4LvmFR0D.
And right now, their goal is to discourage us. We can’t let that happen. Passing this bill—and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act—is our best path toward creating a democracy that truly responds to our votes and our voices. That’s what America should always be about.
This week, Senate Republicans voted against even beginning debate on critical voting rights legislation. Make no mistake, the Freedom to Vote Act is a commonsense bill to protect the fundamental tenet of our democracy—the right to vote. https://t.co/5S01iR7pVJ

A couple years ago, the Florida state government rolled back a measure that would have given many formerly incarcerated Floridians their right to vote. Now, they can only cast a ballot if they pay off their incarceration debt. It's essentially a poll tax. https://t.co/nLFOhrhtEz

One of the greatest honors of my life is being a proud Chicagoan—a daughter of the South Side. When it came time to decide where Barack and I would build the Obama Presidential Center, we knew it had to be in the place we call home. We can’t wait to see this project come to life. https://t.co/JOC6Vcfeji
Barack and I loved surprising the incredible women in the Chicago Women in Trades, some of whom will be helping build the Obama Presidential Center. I am so proud of CWIT for opening doors for girls and women across the city—and even prouder to see these women leading the way! 💪🏾 https://t.co/860X1FaT0g

When we launched the #ObamaScholars program three years ago, we hoped to equip the next generation of leaders with the tools and skills they could use to change their communities for the better. To our newest Scholars—congratulations! We can’t wait to see the good you’ll do. https://t.co/1OpJ7s8cYz

Last night, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act passed in the House of Representatives. Today, I’m celebrating this victory. Because it’s not every day that a landmark bill like this—a bill that will give a voice to so many—has a chance to become law. https://t.co/OKtYOdUwIc

Happy birthday to the woman who taught me how to think for myself, use my voice, and show up authentically in this world. Your belief that I mattered, even when I was just a little girl, led me to where I am today. Thank you for being the ultimate role model. Love you, mom! 💗 https://t.co/IbsPrrRsDt
Am I good enough? Yes, I am. The mantra I practice daily. @Simone_Biles, we are proud of you and we are rooting for you. Congratulations on the the silver medal, Team @USA! 🎊
Everyone deserves to have their voices heard and their votes counted, and I can’t think of a better way to honor Congressman Lewis than by turning these bills into law.
All across our country, the sacred right to vote that he marched and bled for is being threatened. That’s why we’ve got to do everything in our power to pass the #ForThePeopleAct and the #JohnLewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
A year ago today, we lost Congressman John Lewis. As we celebrate the king of good trouble—his legacy of perseverance; his ability to find moments of joy and lightness in the midst of real struggle—we should also recommit ourselves to building the future he envisioned. https://t.co/07nbvnBh9i

Right now, we have the opportunity to enact voting reforms, expand voting rights, and stop dozens of voter suppression bills aimed at limiting access to the ballot box for people across the country by passing the #ForThePeopleAct.
Let's celebrate #Juneteenth becoming a federal holiday by recognizing the generations of enslaved Black people who fought so hard for their freedom. One of the best ways to do that is by fortifying our sacred right to vote. https://t.co/OoT5OJvRCm
It’s almost #FathersDay, so I’m thinking a lot about my dad and reflecting on some of the memories we shared growing up.

One of my favorite parts about sharing my story in Becoming has been having such wonderful conversations with so many of you about your own stories. Here’s a quick look at some of the folks I’ve spoken with recently—it was great to connect with so many of you! #IAmBecoming https://t.co/NZdctUfXFD
When you can get the COVID-19 vaccine, I hope you do—Barack and I are certainly glad we did. It’s our best shot at beating this virus, looking out for one another, and getting back to some of the things we miss. Getting vaccinated will save lives—and that life could be yours. https://t.co/3VlwJbQqvu
So excited that Waffles + Mochi comes out on Netflix next week—and in collaboration with @PHAnews, our Pass the Love campaign will seek to address food insecurity by providing more than one million meals to families in need. Hope you’ll get involved: https://t.co/MH3Kz48dtl https://t.co/xM9hJwUYjx

I’ll miss her dearly, but I smile knowing how many people she inspired, just like me, to walk a little taller, speak a little more freely, and live a little bit more like God intended.
She was the personification of beauty, grace, wisdom, and strength, carrying forward a flame that not only guided her for 96 pathbreaking years but lit the way for so many of us.
What struck me every time I spent time with Cicely Tyson was not necessarily her star power—though that was evident enough—it was her humanity. Just by walking into a room, she had this way of elevating everyone around her. https://t.co/o6VAV63wqd
The Fabulous Ladies Book Club is an example of what is possible when people come together to help their community in times of need. Their incredible organizing work has helped so many people in their town get the COVID-19 vaccine. Way to go, ladies! 👏🏾 https://t.co/QYuh5HrxsW

With so much going on, Dr. King’s leadership is as steadying a force as it’s ever been. I’ve been reflecting a lot on his example, and how it might help us move forward after these last four years. #MLKDay https://t.co/oGCF2wbT18

Like all of you, I’ve been feeling so many emotions since yesterday. I tried to put my thoughts down here: https://t.co/9xzRvrpk7y
🚨 Hey Georgia! If you still have your mail-in ballot, return it to a drop-off location before 7 PM ET today. Find one near you at https://t.co/z56p0wA20l. Let's get it done! 🚨 https://t.co/t2oJgterZd
It’s #ElectionDay in Georgia! If you’re heading to the polls today, get there before they close at 7 PM ET. If you still need to find your polling place or ballot drop-off location for your absentee ballot, go to https://t.co/z56p0wiqBL to get started with @WhenWeAllVote. https://t.co/3eSYwTqu1e
Because in America, everyone’s voice matters. And that’s still the truth, no matter what some folks want you to believe.
If you live in Georgia, make sure you vote for @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff in tomorrow’s U.S. Senate runoffs—and make sure everybody you know does the same. If you’ve already received a mail-in ballot, take it to a drop-box or vote in person at your polling place tomorrow.
So if Georgians elect @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff, we’ll take another step toward cleaning up the mess of the past four years. And we’ll send a message to any politician who puts themselves and their ambition above our system of self-government.
These runoffs will decide whether President-Elect Biden has a Senate that will work with him rather than just obstruct him at every turn.
Tomorrow’s runoffs in Georgia will decide whether the U.S. Senate is run by those who’ve shown their willingness to tear down our democracy—or whether it’ll be run by those who will actually get to work on the monumental challenges before us.
This is why we can’t just vote for President and think that our job is done.
And this is just unconscionable at a time when a staggering number of Americans are dying every day from a virus that was downplayed for far too long. It’s unconscionable to focus on overturning an election rather than helping struggling families or distributing a vaccine.
Your vote is your voice. It’s your power. And right now, from the President of the United States on down, we’re seeing and hearing just how desperate some are to take that power away. They want us to believe that their pride is more important than our democracy.
"Tomorrow’s the last day to vote in the Georgia runoffs for the U.S. Senate and it couldn’t be more important that you make your voice heard.

Find your polling place at https://t.co/z56p0wA20l, and make sure you know your voting rights: https://t.co/NkGlNOpCVQ https://t.co/OCAwS9VwPa"
The last day to vote in the Georgia runoff for the U.S. Senate is this Tuesday, January 5th. If you’re voting in-person on #ElectionDay, you will need an ID. Take a few minutes today to make sure you’re ready to make your voice heard with @WhenWeAllVote and @VoteRiders. https://t.co/AgbOe6uXfO

My warmest congratulations again to Joe and Jill, Kamala and Doug—and each of you who stepped up when your country needed you.
We’ve got to promise each other that our focus in this election won’t be an anomaly, but the rule. That’s how we can not only feel this way right now, but in the months and years ahead. It’s the only way we’ll build a nation worthy of our children.
So it’s up to us to stay engaged and informed, to keep speaking out and marching on. We’ve got to vote in even greater numbers in the upcoming Senate runoffs in Georgia—and every state and local election going forward.
We see now the reality that we can’t take even the tiniest part of our democracy for granted. Every single vote must count — and every single one of us must vote. And as a country, we should be making it easier, not harder to cast a ballot.
But we’ve also got to recognize that the path to progress will always be uphill. We’ll always have to scrape and crawl up toward that mountaintop. And two years from now, four years from now, there will once again be no margin for error.
Let’s remember that tens of millions of people voted for the status quo, even when it meant supporting lies, hate, chaos, and division. We’ve got a lot of work to do to reach out to these folks in the years ahead and connect with them on what unites us.
And after we celebrate — and we should all take a moment to exhale after everything we’ve been through — let’s remember that this is just a beginning. It’s a first step. Voting in one election isn’t a magic wand, and neither is winning one.
Thank you to all of you who poured every ounce of your hope and determination into this democracy over these past four years, registering voters, getting them to the polls, keeping folks informed. More votes were cast in this election than ever before. It’s because of you.
I’m beyond thrilled that my friend @JoeBiden and our first Black and Indian-American woman Vice President, @KamalaHarris, are headed to restore some dignity, competence, and heart at the White House. Our country sorely needs it. https://t.co/yXqQ3tYRoa

Strong. Honest. Clear. Hopeful. Tonight, @KamalaHarris proved that she and @JoeBiden have what it takes to move this country forward. And now it’s up to us to go vote for them. Vote early—do it as soon as you can, in person or by mail. Get started now at https://t.co/vS12U5kabm.
Good luck tonight, @KamalaHarris! You’ve got this. 💪🏾😷 https://t.co/svQBmMvNJB
Thanks for the podcast love, @dopelabspodcast! You’re doing such an amazing job of inspiring your listeners to love science. Keep it up, ladies! #MichelleObamaPodcast https://t.co/g1EyPmV4n2
#ImVotingFor the fundamental decency of Americans to be reflected in the Oval Office. I'm voting for competence over chaos, for unity over division. I'm voting for @JoeBiden because he can bring people together to make our country a whole lot better. https://t.co/oV9sJg8Yvj
Getting an education past high school is still the best investment you can make for your future. I'm so proud that @CommonApp made taking that step a little bit easier for young people, especially for students of color, by removing the school discipline question. #ReachHigher https://t.co/58eLovfgqV
And more than anything, I hope you’ll vote for Joe with power, with passion, and with a love of this country that cannot possibly be denied.
So I hope you’ll watch, and I hope you’ll share this with everyone you know who might still be deciding how or if they’re going to vote.
There’s only one way we can pull ourselves out—by voting for my friend @JoeBiden, who’s got the heart, the experience, and the character to lead us to better days.
Because the drama of the past few days has only emphasized what’s at stake in this election, from the coronavirus to a constant drumbeat of fear, division, and chaos that’s threatening to spiral out of control.
And I’ll be very honest: This is a message I’d planned to release earlier, and after everything that’s happened, I weighed whether or not to go public at all. But I wanted you all to hear what’s been on my mind.
The truth is, the events of the past few days are a bracing reminder of the tragedy that has been this administration’s response to this crisis.
My heart goes out to everyone touched by this virus, from those at the White House, especially the Secret Service and residence staff whose service ought never be taken for granted, to all those names and stories most of us will unfortunately never know. https://t.co/dtEUrcjPAy
There are remarkable organizations all over the world working to ensure girls keep learning safely during the pandemic. As we gear up for the International #DayoftheGirl this week, I hope you’ll support this critical work through the @GirlsAlliance: https://t.co/uAJh9LbSW0.
Ahead of the #DayoftheGirl, I teamed up with @Malala and Priya Mondol from the @GirlsAlliance community for a conversation about an issue close to our hearts: girls' education around the world. https://t.co/KfWNEiswM4
Thank you, Mayor @KeishaBottoms! This is such a critical step for making sure elections in Atlanta can run safely and securely. Mayors and local leaders have the power to step up and do this across the country, and I hope they do. https://t.co/NuO45au69z
Tune in to my episode on the @RachaelRayShow: https://t.co/7NP4RyAsUr
Rachael asked me what’s keeping me up at night, and here’s what I told her: It’s the idea that after all the fear and division and chaos, this president could still get four more years. The choice couldn’t be clearer––we've got to vote for @JoeBiden like our lives depend on it. https://t.co/y0qYHE0iAV
Look, I understand why people are cynical right now. I talked with Conan about what it feels like to be a mother and a person of color in this moment—and how if we want to hope for some change on any of the issues we care about, then we've got to vote for @JoeBiden. https://t.co/A6WTNqH038
Make sure they know how and when they’re going to vote. And then follow up with them, every day, to make sure they cast their ballot. Because in this election, we’ve got to vote for Joe in numbers that cannot be denied. https://t.co/vS12U5kabm
It’s the only way we can get out of this chaos and restore some stability to this country. You can start by reaching out to everyone you know. Make sure they’re registered.
If you were turned off by the President’s behavior last night, I feel you. Believe me, I do. But we can’t let him win by tuning out altogether. That’s what he wants. So turn those feelings into action—turn them into votes for my friend, @JoeBiden. https://t.co/cMKoxiNWVZ

This is how you can finish the work that the generations before you started. By staying open and hopeful, even through tough times. Even through discomfort and pain. Channel your feelings into activism and into this democracy that was designed to respond to those who vote.
Text everybody you know to join you in exercising their constitutional right to protest. Send all your friends a link to register to vote at https://t.co/vhWl2PM2ly. And show up to vote in every election.
So if you’re spending a lot of time hashtagging and posting right now, that’s useful, especially during a pandemic. But it’s only a beginning. Go further.
And if you hold strong with the same faith that carried all those giants before you toward real, measurable progress—you will change the course of history.
"Dr. King was angry. Sojourner Truth was angry. Lucretia Mott, Cesar Chavez, the folks at Stonewall—they were all angry.

But they were also driven by compassion, by principle—by hope."
"To anyone who’s feeling invisible: Know that your story matters. Your ideas, your experiences, your vision for our world all matter.

Your anger—that matters too. But left on its own, it will only corrode, destroy, and sow chaos—on the inside and out."
So much has changed so quickly. And if any of you are confused or scared or angry—or just plain overwhelmed—I just want you to know that you aren’t alone. I am feeling all that, too. And I have a few things I want to say about it. https://t.co/kUZeBzC8xP https://t.co/0zOQpEcX9K

It ends with justice, compassion, and empathy that manifests in our lives and on our streets. I pray we all have the strength for that journey, just as I pray for the souls and the families of those who were taken from us.
It’s up to all of us—Black, white, everyone—no matter how well-meaning we think we might be, to do the honest, uncomfortable work of rooting it out. It starts with self-examination and listening to those whose lives are different from our own.
Race and racism is a reality that so many of us grow up learning to just deal with. But if we ever hope to move past it, it can’t just be on people of color to deal with it.
Like so many of you, I’m pained by these recent tragedies. And I’m exhausted by a heartbreak that never seems to stop. Right now it’s George, Breonna, and Ahmaud. Before that it was Eric, Sandra, and Michael. It just goes on, and on, and on. https://t.co/lFWEtTzVT8
